# CISA VEX Use Case 2

### Single Product, Single Version, Multiple Vulnerabilities, Single Status

In this use case, Example Company has fielded the product ABC with the current version 4.2. The company makes statements about each version of its product in a different VEX file. For a given version of a given product, a particular vulnerability can only have a single status.

When the Ripple20 vulnerabilities were disclosed, customers asked Example Company whether the current version 4.2 of their product ABC is affected. Example Companyâ€™s PSIRT released a VEX file stating that product ABC version 4.2 is not affected, because it does not use the vulnerable stack.

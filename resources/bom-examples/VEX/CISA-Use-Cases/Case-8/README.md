# CISA VEX Use Case 8

### Multiple Products, Multiple Versions, Multiple Vulnerabilities, Multiple Statuses

In this use case, the new Log4j vulnerability CVE-2021-44228, and the subsequent vulnerability CVE-2021-45105, have been identified in components of products ABC and JKL.

Two weeks after CVE-2021-44228, the initial Log4j CVE, is released, an additional Log4j vulnerability with associated CVE-2021-45105 is released. Example Company produces a VEX document stating that the vulnerability disclosed in CVE-2021-44228 is exploitable (status: KNOWN_AFFECTED) in products ABC versions 2.4, 2.6, and 2.9 to 4.1, as well as JKL versions 4.5 to 5.0. The VEX document also states that the vulnerability disclosed in CVE-2021-45105 is exploitable (status: KNOWN_AFFECTED) in the same versions of products ABC and JKL. JKL version 5.1 is also affected by CVE-2021-45105 and therefore the mitigation is now to upgrade to version 5.2. Other mitigations remain the same.
